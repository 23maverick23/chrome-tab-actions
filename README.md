chrome-tab-actions
==================

Handy right click context menu options for tabs. Allows you to easily close all tabs to the left or right, like tabs or all other tabs. Also supports a quick undo feature if you choose the wrong option. Due to limitations in the Chrome API the right-click menu is only available on the page and not on the tab itself.
